# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
A Convolutional Neural Network model is created using PyTorch library over the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits . <br />

The dataset can be downloaded from here : <br />

The MNIST dataset is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.

The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.

<br />

The handwritten digit recognition is the capability of computer applications to recognize the human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different shapes and sizes.The handwritten digit recognition system is a way to tackle this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.
